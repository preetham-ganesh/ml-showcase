# Digit Recognizer

This directory container contains the front-end interface for the [Digit Recognizer](https://github.com/preetham-ganesh/digit-recognizer) project. It provides a web-based UI built with Flask, HTML, and CSS to interact with the ML models deployed in the backend. Users can upload images and view the predictions from the model.
